Harmonic Phonons are modelled on 6x6x6 supercell relative to primitive cell.
VASP input files for phonons (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are in Files_Phonons folder.
Obatined 2nd order force constants are given in FORCE_FC2 format.


Anharmonic phonons are modelled on 4x4x4 supercell relative to primitive cell.
All possible intercations within the supercell are inclused.
displacement amplitude is 0.03 Ang
VASP input files for phonons (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are also given.
Anharmonic IFCs are given in FORCES_FC3.

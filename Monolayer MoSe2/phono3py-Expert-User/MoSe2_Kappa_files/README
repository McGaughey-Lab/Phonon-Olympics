Harmonic Phonons are modelled on 8x8x1 supercell relative to primitive cell.
VASP input files for phonons (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are in MoSe2_Phonons folder.
2nd order force constants are given in force_constants_881.hdf5 files.


Anharmonic phonons are modelled on 6x6x1 supercell relative to primitive cell.
All possible intercations within the supercell are inclused.
displacement amplitude is 0.03 Ang
VASP input files for phonons (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are also given in MoSe2_AnharmonicPhonons
Anharmonic IFCs are given in FORCES_FC3.

To make 3rd order IFCs in hdf5 format following steps are required.

phono3py --dim="6 6 1" --sym-fc

This creates symmetrized fc2.hdf5 and fc3.hdf5 files from FORCES_FC3 corresponding to 8x8x1 supercell.
since we want to use harmonic IFCs from 8x8x1 supercell in kappa calculations, simply replace fc2.hdf5 by force_constants_881.hdf5.

mv force_constants_881.hdf5 fc2.hdf5

Run the thermal conductivity calculations

phono3py --dim="6 6 1" --dim-fc2="8 8 1" --fc2 --nac --fc3 --ts="300" --mesh="101 101 1" --lbte --isotope

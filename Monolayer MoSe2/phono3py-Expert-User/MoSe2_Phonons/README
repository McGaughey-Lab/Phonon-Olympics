Phonons are modelled on 8x8x1 supercel.
VASP input files (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are also shared
Calculated 2nd order force constants are given in FORCE_SETS file.
BORN effective charges and dielectric constants are listed in "BORN"
For calculations of phonon dispersion translation invarince has been imposed. These force constants are written into FORCE_CONSTANTS_881 and  force_constants_881.hdf5 files.

2nd order IFCs from force_constants_881.hdf5  are used for lattice thermal conductivity calculations.

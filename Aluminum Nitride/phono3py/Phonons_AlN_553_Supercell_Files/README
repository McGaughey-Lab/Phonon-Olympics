Phonons are modelled on 5x5x3 supercell relative to primitive cell
VASP input files (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are also shared
Calculated 2nd order force constants are given in FORCE_SETS file
BORN effective charges and dielectric constants are listed in "BORN"
For calculations of phonon dispersion translation invarince has been imposed. These force constants are written into FORCE_CONSTANTS and  force_constants.hdf5 files.

2nd order IFCs from force_constants_553.hdf5  file has been used for lattice thermal conductivity calculations.

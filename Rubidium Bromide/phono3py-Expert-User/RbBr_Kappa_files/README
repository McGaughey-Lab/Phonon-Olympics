Harmonic Phonons are modelled on 5x5x5 supercell relative to primitive cell.
VASP input files for phonons (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are in Files_Phonons folder.
2nd order force constants are given in force_constants_555.hdf5 files.


Anharmonic phonons are modelled on 4x4x4 supercell relative to primitive cell.
All possible intercations within the supercell are inclused.
displacement amplitude is 0.03 Ang
VASP input files for phonons (INCAR and KPOINTS ) are also given.
Anharmonic IFCs are given in FORCES_FC3.

To make 3rd order IFCs in hdf5 following steps are required.

phono3py --dim="4 4 4" --sym-fc

This creates symmetrized fc2.hdf5 and fc3.hdf5 files from FORCES_FC3 corresponding to 4x4x4 supercell.
since we want to use harmonic IFCs from 5x5x5 supercell in kappa calculations, simply replace fc2.hdf5 by force_constants_555.hdf5.

mv force_constants_555.hdf5 fc2.hdf5

Run the thermal conductivity calculations

phono3py --dim="4 4 4" --dim-fc2="5 5 5" --fc2 --nac --fc3 --ts="300" --mesh="41 41 41" --lbte --isotope
